## 1 - Introduction

The RStudio environment includes templates of R Markdown documents proposing
at selection step to chose PDF output format. It is then
easy to render the document, actually simple as a click.

**How to start a PDF in RStudio:**
(1) File > New File > **RMarkdown** ... > Select output PDF and OK;
(2) click the  **knit** button at the top of the source pane.

If starting is easy, the click (bait) is hiding complexity as
the question of PDF output configuration is more challenging
(e.g. add a footnote, change font):

- at least three different nested high-level tools are chained
  together to handle the R Markdown
  document (R, Pandoc and a LaTeX engine), fine tuning a PDF document in
  R consists in passing arguments to the right one using the application
  interface proposed by R.
- two or three ways exist to convey configuration instructions: either
  using a R function arguments, or conveying settings via the yaml front matter
  of the R Markdown document, or eventually through a configuration file.

The aim of the present page is to provide an overview of the tools involved
in the pipeline when triggering the rendering of the PDF document, and how to
how to pass configuration elements to the right underlying tool.


## 2. Material and Methods

A series of minimum working examples were generated to support the
demonstration.
The examples were built at the same time as the results below were reported,
they are available as a GitHub repository:
[Rmd to PDF](https://github.com/FCACollin/rmd_to_pdf).
Diagrams were employed to describe the sequence of tools involved in the
transformation of the R Markdown document to PDF, they were made possible by
the [Mermaid framework](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid).

The environment for the examples was containerized, a docker image and
its definition was used to ensure reproducibility and / or enable the extension
of the work (NÃ¼st et al. 2020).
The Docker definition was made publicly available at
<https://github.com/FCACollin/ayup_dock>.
Note that the image was not originally intended for this specific usage,
this explains why it also includes some R packages and LaTeX dependencies not
strictly necessary for the examples. However, the image as currently
defined was also configured for a research task where pdf reporting was a
requirement. Therefore, it was decided to base the example on this image
as it shows also how it can be used in production for real-life work.

The image includes:

- A rocker/verse image (4.1.0)
- A series of additional R packages.
- A series of LaTeX dependencies. 

In terms of pdf reporting, this image can:

- handles templates.
- use bibliographic references.


## 3 - Results

### 3.1 - R Markdown: `render()`/`pdf_document()`

Producing a pdf document from a R Markdown (rmd) input is managed by R, but also
involves [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/): R pre-process all the R Markdown code
chunks and in-line code converting there result in markdown and generating an
intermediary markdown file (md), Pandoc handles the conversion of the md file
into a pdf document.
The `rmarkdown`'s functions `render()` and `pdf_document()` are high R
level functions which manages most of the features a user might need when
generating a report. The options managed by `pdf_document()` are directly
assigned to the right tool to be interpreted simplifying the interaction
with the _toolchain_. For instance, it accepts argument `toc` resulting in
a Table of Content being added to the output, it also accepts `keep_md`
which enables the inspection of the intermediary markdown file.

{{<mermaid align="left">}}

    participant Rmd
    participant md
    participant pdf
    Rmd->>md: R
    md->>pdf: pandoc
    Rmd->>pdf: rmarkdown::pdf_document()
    Note right of Rmd: keep_md=FALSE</br>toc=TRUE
{{< /mermaid >}}

- The options are passed either via the `yaml` frontmatter
  (e.g. `rmd2pdf_01_03.Rmd`) ...
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Rmd to PDF"
  output:
    pdf_document:
      keep_md: true
      toc: true
  ---
  ```

- ... Or via an output function. Comparing both syntaxes, the first line in the
  yaml front matters below "output" corresponds to the function used by R for
  configuring the output, (`pdf_document`) followed by options which find a
  match in the R function.
  ```r
  library(rmarkdown)
  render(
    input = "rmd2pdf_01_02.Rmd",
    output_format = pdf_document(toc = TRUE, keep_md = TRUE)
  )
  ```

`render` and `pdf_document` are functions exported by the `rmarkdown` package.

### 3.2 - Pass arguments to Pandoc

R's function for rendering a pdf document is a high level function. It includes
arguments which let the user handle some features of interest for a report, but
it is not possible that R's function accounts for all possibilities offered
by the downstream tool Pandoc. This is explained by at list two reasons: Pandoc
is highly configurable and proposes a very large number of configuration
options, Pandoc is an evolving framework, new features are still to be expected
in the future.
For Pandoc, configuration of an output is handled by
_[variables for LaTeX](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex)_ .
In the example above, the option TOC is conveyed to Pandoc directly.
In complement, for the variables which are not directly handled by R's
function (e.g. the font family), the R argument `pandoc_args` leaves the door
opened for more Pandoc variables for LaTeX (e.g. variable `fontfamily`). 

{{<mermaid align="left">}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Rmd
    participant md
    participant pdf
    Rmd->>+md: R
    Note right of Rmd: rmarkdown arguments
    md-->>-pdf: Pandoc
    Note right of md: Variables For LaTeX</br>fontfamily: libertinus-type1
    Rmd->>pdf: rmarkdown::pdf_document()
    Note over Rmd,pdf: keep_md=FALSE, toc=TRUE</br>pandoc_args: fontfamily
{{< /mermaid >}}

The Pandoc variables for LaTeX can be conveyed via:

- either the R Markdown document 
  [yaml front matter](
  https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-variables.html#latex-variables
  ) ...
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "Rmd to PDF"
  output:
    pdf_document:
      keep_md: true
      toc: true
  fontfamily: libertinus-type1
  ---
  ```

- ... Or the `pdf_document()` function. Extra lines in the yaml front matter
  correspond to new `pandoc_args` list items as built below:
    ```r
    rmarkdown::render(
      input = "rmd2pdf_01_03.Rmd",
      output_format = rmarkdown::pdf_document(
        toc = TRUE,
        pandoc_args = list(
          "--variable=fontfamily:libertinus-type1"
        )
      )
    )
    ```

![Modify the font family](img/rmd_to_pdf_03.png)


### 3.3 - Pass arguments to the LaTeX engine

For the same reason which explain why R Markdown can not account for all
possibilities offered by Pandoc, Pandoc being a high level function for LaTeX
can not account for all possibilities offered by a LaTeX engine.
Many expected functionalities are translated via Pandoc, for those which are
not, R's function open the door via the extra dependency argument.

{{<mermaid align="left">}}
sequenceDiagram
    participant Rmd
    participant md
    participant tex
    participant pdf
    Rmd->>md: R
    Note right of Rmd: rmarkdown arguments
    md->>+tex: Pandoc
    Note right of md: Variables For LaTeX
    tex-->>-pdf: LaTeX engine
    Note right of tex: Extra depencendies</br>e.g. fancyhdr
    Rmd->>pdf: rmarkdown::pdf_document()
    Note over Rmd,pdf: keep_md=FALSE, toc=TRUE</br>pandoc_args</br>extra_dependencies
{{< /mermaid >}}

- The yaml front matter is no longer self sufficient, the use of 
  `include/in_header` points at a supplementary `.tex` file:
    + yaml:
    ```yaml
    ---
    title: "Rmd to PDF"
    output:
      pdf_document:
        latex_engine: xelatex
        keep_md: true
        toc: true
        includes:
          in_header: "preamble.tex"
    mainfont: DejaVuSansMono
    ---
    ```
    + `preambule.tex`:
    ```tex
    \usepackage{fancyhdr}
    \pagestyle{fancy}
    \fancyhead[L]{FCollin}
    ```
- The use of `pdf_document()` is an interesting alternative, maybe more
  compact:
  ```r
  rmarkdown::render(
    input = "rmd2pdf_01_04.Rmd",
    output_format = rmarkdown::pdf_document(
      toc = TRUE,
      latex_engine = "xelatex",
      pandoc_args = list("--variable=mainfont:DejaVuSansMono"),
      extra_dependencies = list(
        rmarkdown::latex_dependency(
          "fancyhdr",
          extra_lines = paste(
            "\\pagestyle{fancy}",
            "\\fancyhead[L]{FCollin}"
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
  ```

## 4. Discussion

It was evidenced that the original raw pdf as generated
by a simple click in RStudio, hides complexity. Entering the detail of this
complexity and decomposing the pipeline brings a better understanding of
the possible levels of configuration which can be addressed either through
the R functions, the Pandoc interface or the LaTeX engine. The configuration
of the output is also complex and may take advantage of a knowledge of the
Pandoc command line interface, a better understanding of the YAML format
for configuration, and a basic knowledge of LaTeX may also help in achieving
a very well designed report. This complexity allows an incredible flexibility
in the configuration of the reporting.

However, the complexity can also be seen as hurdle: the increase number
of programming languages decrease the likelihood of finding contributors who
can leverage the whole potential of pdf reporting with R Markdown. To
alleviate this difficulty it is also possible to use templates: in other word,
the configuration of a pdf output is a one-off, it is a deliverable itself
which can be injected in many reporting task (think about it as a corporate
Microsoft word template).

The pdf reporting as presented above, is an illustration of the mechanisms
involved to convert a R Markdown file into a document.
The same applies to render docx, html or other: the markdown file being at the
cross road and Pandoc involved to the final conversion. As for the pdf
documents, all output can take advantage of templates, and markup languages
(e.g. LaTeX or html) accepts headers or other additional configuration files.
