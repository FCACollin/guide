	"content": "2021-03-11, FCA Collin\nStyle Advises Use Comment Appropriately Main reason to comment:\n Code Readability Explanation of the code or Metadata of the project Temporarily prevent execution of code To include resources  https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html (210415):\nIn data analysis code, use comments to record important findings and analysis decisions. If you need comments to explain what your code is doing, consider rewriting your code to be clearer. If you discover that you have more comments than code, consider switching to R Markdown.\nHow to comment https://style.tidyverse.org/functions.html (210415):\n Explain the why and not the what or how Comments should be in sentence case, and only end with a full stop if they contain at least two sentences  Down-side of (bad) comment practice.  Focus and cognitive load: stops screening code because maybe that is important (and 99% of case is not). Hides what’s important: increase the length of the code. If, eventually, it is understood by the programmer who commented it, it is noise to every one else. It is better to keep the code to the necessary piece and as, along with other measures, it will improve code maintenance by preventing to have to look for the needle in the haystack.  Alternative: if all this comment is necessary, use literate programming such as rmarkdown.  The commented code does not evolve and may become out of date: and this is a problem as all the code should work. Unfinished job: the comment can be an alternative code as the programmer thinks “*maybe that could be another valid approach*”. The programmer is still the better placed to decided what is better, or may ask advises, but the job will be finish when finally ruling the decision. Alternative:  if it is hard to decide, take the time to weight the decision, eventually ask another colleague. if the decision must be documented: consider literate programming with rmarkdown.  Someone else will delete it. As ambiguous, someone may decide to delete the commented code. If this was really informative, that will be a loss which could have been prevented (i.e. literate programming, unit tests). Some programmers think:  I’ll Delete Your Commented Code Without Reading It and I’m Not Sorry https://blog.submain.com/delete-commented-code-without-reading/   Around the Web:\n https://kentcdodds.com/blog/please-dont-commit-commented-out-code https://agiletribe.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/never-leave-commented-code-in-the-source/ https://blog.submain.com/delete-commented-code-without-reading/  Few quotes:\n The cost of that commented code always outweighs the benefit. Deleting commented code is an easy and effective way to improve the code base, without any risk of negative consequences.  sessionInfo() ## R version 4.0.4 (2021-02-15) ## Platform: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu (64-bit) ## Running under: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster) ## ## Matrix products: default ## BLAS: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/openblas/libblas.so.3 ## LAPACK: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libopenblasp-r0.3.5.so ## ## locale: ## [1] LC_CTYPE=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NUMERIC=C ## [3] LC_TIME=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_COLLATE=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [5] LC_MONETARY=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.UTF-8 ## [7] LC_PAPER=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_NAME=C ## [9] LC_ADDRESS=C LC_TELEPHONE=C ## [11] LC_MEASUREMENT=en_GB.UTF-8 LC_IDENTIFICATION=C ## ## attached base packages: ## [1] stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base ## ## loaded via a namespace (and not attached): ## [1] compiler_4.0.4 magrittr_2.0.1 tools_4.0.4 htmltools_0.5.1.1 ## [5] yaml_2.2.1 stringi_1.5.3 rmarkdown_2.6 knitr_1.31 ## [9] stringr_1.4.0 xfun_0.22 digest_0.6.27 rlang_0.4.10 ## [13] evaluate_0.14 "

	"content": " 2021-06-22, FCA Collin\nStarting with Git from a user perspective.\nWhy should I use Git?  Back up:  If I did a mistake I can roll back to a previously working stage.  Version control:  some versions are definitely working and might be used \u0026hellip; it does not stop me to carry on the programming (e.g. I want to add a new feature, I want to correct something) and eventually update the project: all is self contained (no copy paste from a draft directory to a production one)  Collaboration:  Easy to share code. It can be a communication channel. many users can contribute simultaneously.   Where is the difficulty?  With a great power 🕸 \u0026hellip;:  Many possibilities, can be overwhelming. But: start with git branching workflow (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows).\n  It relies on the Command Line Interface:  But: many graphical user interface, including RStudio.   Basic command Git: I want to \u0026hellip; start! Starting a git repository is simple, in the terminal git init. Where the command is invoked, it makes a .git directory which will contain the git base. However, creating a git directory is not enough, the user must decide if a file should be version controled.\nGit: I want to keep track of a new file. Using git add myfile must be understand as Git, I would like to check the evolution of the file myfile. Then for every change or stage I would like to keep track of: git commit myfile -m \u0026quot;An informative short description\u0026quot;.\nAn alternative way is to add all the files git add . and commit all git commit -am \u0026quot;Another informative commit desc..\nOf course, many IDE propose convenient graphical user interface for these operations: e.g. with RStudio, this action is done by ticking check boxes.\nGit: I don\u0026rsquo;t to track a file, never. There is this draft.R file which I don\u0026rsquo;t want to commit. To do so, I add a file .gitignore where I add the following line:\ndraft.R  I could even be more efficient and avoid every single file including the mention draft in its title, I would adapt the .gitignore file:\n*draft*  Branching Git: I want to create a draft version of the project. Git always commit modifications in a branch, the default branch is called master. The command git branch returns the list of branches:\n* master  With the command git checkout -b draft I am creating and checking out a new branch (-b named draft). All commits will be added in that branch. Looking at git branch I definitelly have two branches, the checked-out branch:\n* devel master  And I can check out the master branch again with git checkout master.\nGit, I want to merge devel in master I am satisfied with the modification I made in master, I tested it works and does not break the previous features. This modification is in the devel branch, I want to add it to the main branch. Then I need to check out the destination branch git checkout master, and merge with git merge devel. In that case, all my commits will now be part of the main branch (it has been fast forwarded, git terminology). If I want to by pass these intermediate commit and just merge the final result, I would use git merge devel --no-ff -m \u0026quot;With a message\u0026quot;.\nGit, I believe you, but I want to see the branches With git log all the commits will be visible, you can track back the full history of the work. You can define your log differently setting some optionss, e.g. git log --graph --all --decorate --oneline:\n* 5136332 (HEAD -\u0026gt; main, tag: v0.3.4, origin/main) Release |\\ | * a94f0c0 (origin/devel, devel) Addition of GSEA per WGCNA module | |\\ | | * 45fdfb1 (origin/20_gomod, 20_gomod) release | | * a58bb47 wgcna gsea go - ready | | * 42df79e per-module geneset selection | | * 5b7dd98 ongoing draft for gsea per wgcna module | | * b221a86 ongoing draft: go per module | |/ | * 668307c Up version |/ * c0b4475 minor fix * 2557230 Release version 0.3.3 |\\ | * f288328 Results of the miRNA analysis. | |\\ | | * 46fabb6 (origin/19_mirna, 19_mirna) Report review | | * 8aec514 clean | | * fc0b74a Refactoring for consistent VST normalisation | | * c16d08e mirna traits cor training | | * 5fc87aa mir: trait to gene correlation matrix, ongoing | | * c422edc Fig022 and improvement Fig008 | | * dc3f46a Fig021 miRNA volcano Training All | | * 19c9077 Fig020 mRNA volcano Training All | | * f9db6fc up version | | |\\ | |/ / |/| / | |/ | * a47a792 Up version * | 8cf34f9 (tag: v0.3.2) Delivery |\\ \\ | |/ | * 56c2f92 Production | |\\ | | * 02683e7 (18_rnaseq_res) add wgcna results | | * ace4aa1 (origin/18_rnaseq_res) export module gene in table and graph | | * 93bdaa9 Fig014 and Fig015 WGCNA Baseline | | * f11910f WGCNA cut in pieces | | * 074da27 WGCNA up scalling and modules | | * 6205e38 WGCNA object for upscaling (case A and B) | | * d0bc2e6 Prototype for trait to gene correlation matrix | | * fa4a938 Network - start with ME to traits correlations | | * efb67cc WGCNA: ind cluster and sft threshold | | * 21c09f8 Started WGCNA | | * 0f75d87 Merge branch 'main' into 18_rnaseq_res | | |\\ | |_|/ |/| | * | | e73c97e (tag: v0.3.1) Release |\\ \\ \\ | |/ / | | * 49ce03c Up-versioned  And if you want it cool: https://www.gitkraken.com/.\nCloning Git: I want to have my copy of the work. For that I need to clone the repository; the command git clone /file/path/to/the/repo, will make a copy of it in a new folder repo where the command was invoked. What is happening? Git is defining a communication channel, communication involves two parties:\n an emettor, later call the local. a receptor, later called a remote.  This new repo folder is the local, and it communicates with the remote /file/path/to/the/repo. Generally, there are two ways of communications:\n pulling: we take information from the remote (e.g. you can pull a branch) pushing: we send information to the remote (e.g. you can push a branch).  Git: I want to participate to a project Working with a copy of the work (see above), I can create a branch in my local machine. Once I did that, I should decide which branch is the starting point to contribute (we should expect devel, industry standard). Then I would create my own branch which will be synchronised with the remote location. Later, I will be able, distintly to:\n add new modification to my branch (commits) and send them to the corresponding branch in the remote: git push origin 01_mybranch.  even better:  firt time I push: git push -u origin 01_mybranch (-u for set upstream) then for the future push git push.    My branch can be used for:\n proposing new features. communicating feedback. fork the project to adapt to my own needs.  "

	"content": "2021-01-11, FCA Collin (update 2021-01-12)\nPresentation The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) is a general representation of a binary classifier; it accounts for:\n the sensitivity (the proportion of real positive case detected), the false positive rate (1 - sensitivity), the general performance via the area under the ROC curve (AUC).  The classifier for the example identifies tumour tissues (yes/no) in the case of lung cancer (LC) or eventually identifies the Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) histological subtype. The dataset used for the graphic requires at least columns for the sensitivity, the false-positive rate and a decision rule represented by a threshold proportion, in that case varying from 0 to 1. Additionally, information about the classifier itself can include the model identification (LC, SCC), as well as the AUC (+ confidence interval estimation) as a overall evaluation of the models.\nData Lets dtaplot being as example dataset such as:\n   Threshold Sensitivity Specificity FalseAlarm ntree auc.ci auc Diag     Inf 0.0000000 1 0 10000 0.925-0.984 0.954 2) SCC   Inf 0.0000000 1 0 10000 0.938-0.989 0.964 1) LC   0.96445 0.0097087 1 0 10000 0.925-0.984 0.954 2) SCC   0.95860 0.0194175 1 0 10000 0.925-0.984 0.954 2) SCC   0.95375 0.0291262 1 0 10000 0.925-0.984 0.954 2) SCC   0.95285 0.0388350 1 0 10000 0.925-0.984 0.954 2) SCC    Some decision rules (threshold) were of interest:\n Min. error is the threshold for which the classifier overall error was at its minimum.
